# Analytics

## Healthcare Churn Analysis

This project documents my analytical work with a small team on real (anonymized) healthcare data. 

Our analysis was developed with client and expert consultations and presented to senior leadership in a conference setting.

	Skills: ML Modeling, Feature Engineering, Visualization, EDA, Data Wrangling
	Programs: RStudio
	Downloads: Healthcare Churn Analysis.qmd
## EHR Data Transformation

This project documents my data transformation work with a small team on a large, randomly generated healthcare dataset.

We used Alteryx and MySQL to perform data transformations, computation, joins, and exports. 

	Skills: Data Transformation, Computation, Joining, SQL
	Programs: Alteryx Designer, MySQL Workbench
	Downloads: EHR Data Transformation.yxzp - import into Alteryx Designer

# Decision Making

## AI Car Decision Tree

I constructed a decision tree using Bayes Theorem to determine if a fictional car company should release a new product or not.

	Skills: Bayesian Probability, Decision Tree Modeling, Mermaid
	Programs: RStudio
	Downloads: AI Car Decision Tree.qmd

## Gravel Futures Decision Tree

I constructed a decision tree using EMV (Expected Monetary Value) calculations to determine the best supply purchasing option for a fictional construction company.

	Skills: EMV Calculations, Probability Theory, Decision Tree Modeling, Mermaid
	Programs: RStudio
	Downloads: Gravel Futures Decision Tree.qmd

# Problem Solving

## Trailer Packing Problem

I formulated and programmed an optimization model to pack as many pallets into as few trailers as possible.

	Skills: Optimization Modeling, Python, Gurobi
	Programs: Python, Excel
	Downloads: Trailer Packing Problem.ipynb, pallets.xlsx

## Factory Distribution Problem

I formulated and programmed an optimization model to distribute required deliveries across a small shipping network at minimum cost.

	Skills: Optimization Modeling, Python, Gurobi
	Programs: Python
	Downloads: Factory Distribution Problem.ipynb

## Product Mix Problem

I formulated and programmed an optimization model to produce the most profitable mix of a given set of products.

# Simulation

## Bitcoin Simulation

I wrote a simulation program predicting the price of Bitcoin according to an arbitrary Brownian motion term.

	Skills: Visualization, Simulation, Dplyr
	Programs: RStudio
	Downloads: Bitcoin Simulation.qmd
	
## Overbooking Simulation 

I wrote a simulation program finding the minimally costly number of seats to overbook for a fictional airline.

	Skills: Visualization, Simulation, Dplyr
	Programs: RStudio
	Downloads: Overbooking Simulation.qmd
